# Atmega*8 Programming Backpack

Instant ICSP/FTDI headers that fit over your Atmega*8 on the breadboard.

I got tired of always using jumpers to break out the ICSP pins for programming and the TX/RX pins for debugging. It took up precious space on my breadboard and made the whole thing messier. 

So I made a little breakout board that conveniently fits right over my Atmega*8 (168, 328) chips. When I'm done programming, I can remove it and all that's left is the main circuit with none of the extra crap. 

The initial prototype just broke out the ICSP header block, the new version has headers for an FTDI cable, a power indicator LED and a reset button.
