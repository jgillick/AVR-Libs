Generic AVR Makefile
--------------------

Here's my generic AVR makefile that I adapted from
[here](https://github.com/hexagon5un/AVR-Programming/blob/master/setupProject/Makefile).
This file is setup to compile `C++` files. If you want to make it work for `C` files, change
references to `.cpp` to `.c`.
